Yet Another Compiler
====================

Build requirements: antlr4, meson, ninja, llvm

Build instructions
------------------

Adjust paths in Makefile, meson.build and compile.sh as needed.

1. make (everytime you change the grammar)
2. meson build (one-time)
3. ninja -C build

To use: `compile.sh <prog.mpy>`

Why is this called minipy?
--------------------------

I originally envisioned a Python-like syntax but Antlr got the better of me.
